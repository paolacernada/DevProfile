# DevProfile: Dynamic GitHub Bio Site

## Introduction
Welcome to DevProfile! This project is my personal creation, an interactive bio page that dynamically retrieves and displays my GitHub profile information. Using Ajax and the GitHub API.

## Setting Up DevProfile
Before diving in, ensure you have a basic understanding of the GitHub API and web development. There are no starter files, so you'll be crafting the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.

### Starting Steps
1. **Explore GitHub API**: Understand how to retrieve data by examining [GitHub API Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).
2. **Create Files**: Set up your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Link them together properly.
3. **AJAX Calls**: Use Ajax to fetch data from `https://api.github.com/users/your-username-here`.
4. **Testing**: Utilize tools like Insomnia to test your AJAX calls.

### HTML & CSS
- Begin with a basic HTML structure.
- Style your page to your liking or as per the provided mockup.
- Optionally, include Font Awesome for icons:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css" />
  ```

## Features
- **Dynamic Profile Info**: Retrieves your GitHub name, username, and avatar dynamically.
- **Repository Listing**: Shows a list of your GitHub repositories.
- **Interactive Links**: Your GitHub username and repo names are clickable links.
- **Custom Styling**: Freedom to style your profile page as you desire.

## Development Journey
This project is a testament to my skills in web development, API integration, and creative design. It goes beyond a static profile, offering a live insight into my coding world.

## Conclusion
DevProfile is more than just a project; it's a reflection of my journey as a developer. Dive in, explore the code, and see the fusion of API and front-end magic.

Enjoy exploring my GitHub journey through DevProfile!
